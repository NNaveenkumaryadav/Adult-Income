**Adult Income Classification — Production ML Pipeline & API**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Client → REST API → ML Pipeline → Prediction → JSON Response

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning classification pipeline for Adult Income prediction and deploys it as a REST API using FastAPI. The system includes data preprocessing, categorical encoding with ColumnTransformer, model training, pipeline packaging, and real-time prediction endpoints with probability outputs.


**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Decision Tree, Pipeline, OneHotEncoder, Joblib, REST API
**Key Skills:** Classification modeling, categorical encoding, ML pipelines, model evaluation, production ML workflow

project becomes API-based when:

Input JSON → API endpoint → ML pipeline → Prediction → JSON response


If users/applications can call your model like this:

POST /predict

and get prediction output — it is an API-based ML project.
